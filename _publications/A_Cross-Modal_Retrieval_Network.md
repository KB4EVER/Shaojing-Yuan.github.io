permalink: /publications/A_Cross-Modal_Retrieval_Network
excerpt: This network is divided into two parts, which include object detection sub-network, and multi-grained sub-networks. First, we use object detection to extract foreground objects, then innovatively build an object detection sub-network. Secondly, we further divide multi-grained data into multi-level fine-grained and coarse-grained data. We use the sliding window strategy to divide images and texts into different fine-grained levels, then construct the multi-level fine-grained sub-networks and the coarse-grained sub-network. Finally, we linearly fuse the similarity matrix of the object detection sub-network and multi-grained sub-networks. This matrix reflects the complementary relationship between foreground objects and multi-level backgrounds.
